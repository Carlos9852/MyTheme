# MyTheme

Custom theme for Arduino IDE platform. This Theme was based on Jeff Thompson's project: https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkArduinoTheme

### Installation
Users should look for the `lib` folder in the following repositories:
* Mac users: `~/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside (making a copy of the original in case want to revert back).  
* Windows users: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib`.  
* Linux users: `/usr/share/arduino/lib/`-note you may need to install the Arduino IDE from the Arduino site, not a place like Ubuntu Software.

For the theme update, you must replace and rename the original `theme` folder with the modified one (always make a backup of the original folder if you want to reverse the process)

### Note

This theme has only been tested on version 1.8.19. Newer/older versions may not work!
